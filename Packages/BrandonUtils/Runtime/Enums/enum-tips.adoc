<<_real_world_json_based_rest_apis>>, like <<api-scryfall, Scryfall>> and <<api-github, Github>>, almost exclusively use `snake_case` as their {naming-convention}[naming convention].

C#'s standard is https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_Serialization_NamingStrategy.htm[`PascalCase`]{sp}footnote:[Unity suggests using `camelCase` in confusing cases (CITATION NEEDED),{sp}which is annoying.].

[#_google_json_style_guide]
=== https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml[Google JSON Style Guide]

It turns out that the JSON specification does _not_ prescribe a naming strategy.

The "most official" specification I could find is the https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Property_Name_Format#Property_Name_Format[Google JSON Style Guide].

==== Naming Strategy


Google's prescribed https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Property_Name_Format#Property_Name_Format[property name format] (aka "naming strategy") is `camelCase`, _not_ `snake_case`:


.https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Property_Name_Format#Property_Name_Format[Property Name Format]
[source,json]
----
{
  "thisPropertyIsAnIdentifier": "identifier value"
}
----

NOTE: This goes against the conventions of basically all of the <<_real_world_json_based_rest_apis>>, like <<api-scryfall, Scryfall>> and <<api-github, Github>>

Google specifically revokes this restriction when using https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Key_Names_in_JSON_Maps#Key_Names_in_JSON_Maps[maps] _(a synonym for dictionaries)_:

.https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Key_Names_in_JSON_Maps#Key_Names_in_JSON_Maps[Key Names in JSON Maps]
[source,json]
----
{
  // The "address" property is a sub-object <.>
  // holding the parts of an address.
  "address": {
    "addressLine1": "123 Anystreet",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "state": "XX",
    "zip": "00000"
  },
  // The "thumbnails" property is a map that maps
  // a pixel size to the thumbnail url of that size.
  "thumbnails": {
    "72": "http://url.to.72px.thumbnail", // <.>
    "144": "http://url.to.144px.thumbnail"
  }
}

<.> I find it funny that Google includes comments in their examples, despite https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Comments#Comments[specifically prohibiting them].{wj}footnote:[When I grabbed that link I saw that they actually do have a disclaimer regarding the comments: _"Some of the examples in this style guide include comments. However this is only to clarify the examples."_]
<.> Their example starts with a number, which is normally not allowed.

Their reasoning for allowing non-standard names in maps is:

. In most programming languages, properties are accessed as variables:
+
[source,c#]
----
GameObject.name; // <.>
GameObject.7; // <.>
----
<.> Allowed
<.> Not allowed

. In most programming languages, map / dictionary values are accessed using an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexer_(programming)[indexer]{wj}footnote:[Google's explanation: _"Clients can access these properties using the square bracket notation familiar for maps (for example,{sp}``result.thumbnails["72"\]``)."_]:
+
[source,c#]
----
defenses["fire"]; // <.>
defenses["%99"]; // <.>

<.> Legal
<.> Also legal

==== https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Flattened_data_vs_Structured_Hierarchy#Flattened_data_vs_Structured_Hierarchy[Flattened data vs Structured Hierarchy]{wj}footnote:[Google did not put a period after "vs.", which sort of invalidates the rest of the style guide.]

Google prescribes that _"Data elements should be 'flattened' in the JSON representation.
Data should not be arbitrarily grouped for convenience."_

They then provide an example of when data _should_ be grouped:

.Flattened Address
[source,json]
--
{
  "company": "Google",
  "website": "https://www.google.com/",
  "addressLine1": "111 8th Ave",
  "addressLine2": "4th Floor",
  "state": "NY",
  "city": "New York",
  "zip": "10011"
}
--

.Structured Address
[source,json]
--
{
  "company": "Google",
  "website": "https://www.google.com/",
  "address": {
    "line1": "111 8th Ave",
    "line2": "4th Floor",
    "state": "NY",
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10011"
  }
}
--

However, Google does *not* provide an example of a "bad", "arbitrary" grouping.
I think their intention is that you if you are in doubt, you should flatten things.

CAUTION: I disagree with this *wholeheartedly*.

I _think_ I see where they are coming from - for example, at work we have 2 _slightly_ different JSON structures that we could combine into one:

[source,json]
--
{
  "standard_features": {
    "feature": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  },

  "optional_features": {
    "feature": {
      "enabled": true,
      "optional:": false
    }
  }
}
--

And there is definitely something to be said for flattening that structure.

However, a counter-example from work{wj}footnote:[The names of variables have been anonymized to protect their identities.] is a record we have that combines a bunch of different types of values _and_ values added by https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/[Amazon DynamoDB]:

[source,json,caption="a"]
--
{
  "amazon#junk": "8177e0e7-ff1f-4a80-b545-38c36bed6379", // <.> <.>
  "ttl": 9999, // <.>
  "TOTAL_DISTANCE" : "5:00", // <.>
  "TOTAL_FAST_DISTANCE" : 1, // <.>
  "day": "Monday",
  "speed": "5:00", // <.>
  "SPEED_2": "9", // <.>
  "SPEED_4": "g",
  "SPEED_6": "purple",
  "SPEED_8": "U+9001" // <.>
}
--
<.> This stuff was added by https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/[Amazon DynamoDB], but is mixed in with the "real" information
<.> _And_ it has a `#` in it (which DynamoDB is _obsessed_ with), which goes against basically every standard ever!
<.> This _might_ have been added by us and not DynamoDB, but it's a variable that only matters to DynamoDB - and is again mixed in with the "real" data!
<.> What data type is this?It looks like time, but then why is it called `_DISTANCE`?
<.> Is this value related to `TOTAL_DISTANCE`? 'cus it sure looks like it is!
<.> Is this related to the `SPEED_\{X}` variables?
<.> Are the `SPEED_\{X}` variables related to each other?
<.> I may be exaggerating _slightly_{wj}footnote:[I should go to bed]
