    /// It also implements <see cref="IPrimaryKeyed{T}"/>, where <see cref="X"/> is the <see cref="PrimaryKey"/>.

    /// <example>
    /// <see cref="Pair{TX,TY}"/>s are primarily useful when you'd like to take advantage of <see cref="SerializableAttribute"/> fields in the Unity editor.

    /// For example:
    /// <code><![CDATA[
    /// public Pair<DayOfWeek,Color> MondayColor;
