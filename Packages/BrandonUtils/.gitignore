# NuGet packages embedded inside of the BrandonUtils package (which...I think works?)
# Specifically, the first line excludes all of the different "lib" folders,
# and then the second line explicitly re-includes `netstandard2.0`.
# This is in order to:
#   - Not include multiple DLLs with the same name, which NuGet otherwise would download (i.e. one for standard 2.0, one for .net 4.X, etc.)
#   - Make sure the `netstandard2.0` folder, and all of the related .meta files, ARE still included,
#     because the .meta files include the "amdef"-like import settings for each `.dll`.
