# == UPDATE 10/11/2022 ==
# =======================
# Using `NuGetCleaner.ps1` or `Nuget.psm1` -> `Remove-DuplicateNugets` should be a better solution to this problem than the `.gitignore` file was, which is silent and therefore very surprising. 

# NuGet packages embedded inside of the BrandonUtils package (which...I think works?)
# Specifically, the first line excludes all of the different "lib" folders,
# and then the second line explicitly re-includes `netstandard2.*` -
# which should include `netstandard2.0` and `netstandard2.1`.
#
# This is in order to:
#   - Not include multiple DLLs with the same name, which NuGet otherwise would download (i.e. one for standard 2.0, one for .net 4.X, etc.)
#   - Make sure the `netstandard2.0`/`1` folder, and all of the related .meta files, ARE still included,
#     because the .meta files include the "asmdef"-like import settings for each `.dll`.
#
# Note that whenever you make any changes with the `.dll` files you should run `NuGetCleaner.ps1` to ensure that only the `.netstandard2.1` files are included.
