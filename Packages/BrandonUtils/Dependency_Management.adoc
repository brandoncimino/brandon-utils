== Nuget Packages

[TIP,title="TL;DR"]
====
- Defined in a **solution**'sfootnote:[Nuget is the standard package manager for _all_ .NET programs, so it is tied to the universal `.sln` ("solution") and `.csproj` ("project") files.] link:package.json[] file.
- *Embedded* inside of the project, meaning that the code assemblies _(`.dll` files)_ are checked-in to git.
- _Can_ include non-code files{wj}footnote:[link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#including-content-files[.nuspec reference: Including content files]], but should do this sparingly.
- Requires link:NuGetCleaner.ps1[] to be run whenever a dependency is updated.
