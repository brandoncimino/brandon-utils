|`.NET 4.x`|`.NET Standard 2.0`

|> *.NET 4.x.* This profile provides access to the latest .NET 4 API.
It includes all of the code available in the .NET Framework class libraries *and supports .NET Standard 2.0 profiles as well.* Use the .NET 4.x profile if your project requires part of the API not included in the .NET Standard 2.0 profile.

|> *.NET Standard 2.0.* This profile matches the .NET Standard 2.0 profile published by the .NET Foundation.
*Unity recommends .NET Standard 2.0 for new projects.* It's smaller than .NET 4.x, which is advantageous for size-constrained platforms.

|> ...some parts of this API may not be supported on all of Unity's platforms.

|> ...Unity has committed to supporting this profile across all platforms that Unity supports.
